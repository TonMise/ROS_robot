# ROS_robot
Robot files for a personal project

In this repository you can find all the ROS code, along with some Arduino code and some of the designs I made for a robot, for my Treball de Recerca.

This robot implements SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) by using ROS and Google Cartographer. This robot uses an RPLidar A1M8 and a Pixhawk connected to an NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

You can find the Fusion 360 designs here:

If you want to read it, you can also find the PDF of my Treball de Recerca in this repository (it's written in catalan).
